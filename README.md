This is an advanced project for students and principal of college's 

Solution: used academic calander of every department's and degrees (arts, pharmacy, diploma etc ) ,use it to understand 
 
working days , events , holidays from every department calanders and use it to predit date conflicts(comming up exams ,working days etc) 

and generte an alternative date with accurate reasoning .

Problem: the issue has in big collages are Time and Conformations from a broader departments and HOD's .
the only solution for students were to gather conformation letters from each department and this consumed Time . while other issues are Time for Fund raising for programs etc   

The Technical issue was using details of every department required too much tokens for AI .
so i solved this using my own function with a logic that :
it will check if there is working days ,
it will check by using a an equation that will substract the woring days from holidays while again substation of existing events +2(days for gathering funds , decorationsetc)
equation has still a bit more to explain .

 but thankyou for reading
